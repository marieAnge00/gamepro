### ES Modules in Node

We use ECMAScript Modules in the backend in this project. Be sure to have at least Node v14.6+ or you will need to add the "--experimental-modules" flag.

Also, when importing a file (not a package), be sure to add .js at the end or you will get a "module not found" error

You can also install and setup Babel if you would like

### Env Variables

you must create a .env file in then root and add the following

```
NODE_ENV = development
PORT = 5000
MONGO_URI = your mongodb uri
JWT_SECRET = 'abc123'
PAYPAL_CLIENT_ID = your paypal client id
```

### Install Dependencies (frontend & backend)

```
npm install
cd frontend
npm install
```

### Run

```
# Run frontend (:3000) & backend (:5000)
npm run dev

# Run backend only
npm run server
```

## Build & Deploy

```
# Create frontend prod build
cd frontend
npm run build
```

No need to postbuild the script before the deployment in heroku

### Seed Database

You can use the following commands to seed the database with some sample users and products as well as destroy all data

```
# Import data
